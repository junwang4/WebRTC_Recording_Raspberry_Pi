# An Example of Using Python WebRTC_VAD to Record Conversation from Microphone

Wiseman is the author of [python interface to the WebRTC Voice Activity Detector (VAD)](https://github.com/wiseman/py-webrtcvad). In his repository, he provides an excellent example to demonstrate how to segment a wave file to a group of voiced ones.

Based on his example, here I show how to record conversation from microphone in a background service (e.g. a service launched on a Raspberry Pi).
